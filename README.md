To use it, you need to use the version 4 of the leap motion driver "ORION"
you can find it here : https://developer.leapmotion.com/releases/leap-motion-orion-410-99fe5-crpgl

then you'll have to enable web applications in the settings of the leap motion (icon in the task bar, right clic => parameters => enable web app)
